 * @brief Assign each channel with a capacitance greater than the specified
 * threshold to a *"drop group"*.
 *
 * Each *drop group* contains a list of channels that correspond to a
 * contiguous set of electrodes where:
 *
 *   1. Each electrode has some detected liquid on it.
 *   2. There exists a path between any two electrodes in the set (given the
 *      list of channel neighbours).
 *
 * Given the above criteria, we assume that each *drop group* corresponds to a
 * single drop of liquid, spanning one or more electrodes.
 *
 * @tparam Neighbours
 * @tparam Capacitances
 * @tparam Channels
 * @param neighbours  Container of neighbour structs (with `up`, `down`,
 *   `left`, and `right` attributes), one for for each channel with the index
 *   position in the container corresponding to the respective channel number.
 * @param capacitances  List of capacitance measurements, each corresponding to
 *   respective channel number in `channels`.
 * @param channels  List of channel numbers, each corresponding to respective
 *   capacitance measurement in `capacitances`.
 * @param c_threshold  Threshold (in Farads) to consider a channel "occupied".
